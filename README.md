# 🦕 Hello! I’m Nathan Barlow! 🦖
I am a software developer, a gamer, a Christian, and many other things!
- 👨‍💻 Currently I am learning about [SRE](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/), the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/), and [Scheme](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html)!
- 🏄‍♂️ In my spare time I like to play video games, watch anime, and browse old websites for inspiration for my next passion!
